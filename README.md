# Front-en Javascript Challenge - Calendar

This is a Front-end challenge to Jobsity. It is meant to test knowledge of front-end web technologies and the
ability to create front-end UI products with attention to details, cross-browser compatibility,
standards, and reusability.

It consists on a demo calendar application using React [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

It installs all the dependencies and makes it ready to run.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

## Missing functionalities

Due to available time, not all functionalities were created. In any case, here is the list of the priorities:

1. Weather service call from a free API to get the weather forecast for the date of the calendar reminder based on the city.
2. Unit testing the majority of components of the project
